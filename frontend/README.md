# Frontend Demo using SilkHQ Components

This demo shows a vertically scrolling feed with large cards similar to a dating app. It relies on SilkHQ web components served from a CDN. A toggle button switches between light and dark themes.

## Running

Open `index.html` in a modern browser. The page loads SilkHQ components from a CDN so internet access is required.
